Founded by Isabel Leite, a modern woman who idealized the creation of a space where you can finally treat yourself to all hair services with taste, quality and good prices. Our priority is work well done and transparent.

In 2016 this dream became reality. The Salon has known professionals very attentive to national and international references. Pause Urbaine is located in the heart of Geneva, but today we serve regular clients from various regions of the Canton, with the best brands available on the market in combination with comfort, safety and efficiency. We use high-end equipment and products.
